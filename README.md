# ArgoCD Gomplate Image

Container image that provides the tooling needed for ArgoCD's gomplate-based config management plugin. This image is used as a sidecar container in ArgoCD's repo-server to process Helm charts with gomplate templating.

## Overview

This repository contains the Dockerfile for building a container image with Helm, gomplate, and kubectl. The image is used by the ArgoCD plugin configuration defined in the [argocd-config](https://github.com/arturo-builds-infra/argocd-config) repository.

**Part of the ArgoCD ApplicationSet Pattern:**
- Main pattern repository: [argocd-applicationset-pattern](https://github.com/arturo-builds-infra/argocd-applicationset-pattern)
- ArgoCD plugin configuration: [argocd-config](https://github.com/arturo-builds-infra/argocd-config)
- **This repository**: Container image with required tooling

## What's in the Image

The image is based on Alpine Linux and includes:

- **kubectl** - Latest stable Kubernetes CLI
